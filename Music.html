  <h3> Music Q&A
  </h3>
<h4>
  <li> Favorite Genre:
    My favorite genre of music is rap. I think it's a very difficult and unique type of music. The amount of talent needed to rap is unimaginable. Even if an artist does manage to gain attention with one of their songs, they must consistently continue to make catchy music to maintain the interest of their fans. 
  </li>
  <li> When Do I Listen To Music:
    I usually listen to music whenever I have spare time (primarily in the car), I just go on spotify and listen to my playlist for as long as I can. It allows me to have a good time, listening to my favorite songs. Beyond this, music helps you calm down and forget about all the stressful things happening in your life. Music 100% makes everything better.
 </li>
  <li> A Huge Benefit of Music:   
    I believe one of the biggest benefits music has is the opportunity it gives all these people. Some people that maybe aren't to good at school or are having trouble financially can get into music and earn some money. Although it is hard to blow up and get paid a lot, there is still a chance. Nowadays, many people are wanting to become rappers or singers and many have actually achieved their goal.</li>
